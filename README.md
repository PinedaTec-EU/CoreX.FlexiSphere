# FlexiSphere

FlexiSphere is a C#Â library (net 9), extensible and configurable component for managing events and scheduled tasks. This project allows you to define triggers and jobs that execute based on certain conditions.

## Features

- **EventTrigger**: Activates when an adhoc implemented logic returns true. It runs every 500ms (configurable).
- **ScheduledTrigger**: Executes at intervals configured according to a cron expression.
- **Jobs**: Configured with at least one job that meets a specific interface and executes when any of the triggers activate.
